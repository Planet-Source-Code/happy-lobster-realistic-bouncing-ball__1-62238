### Description

A realistic, interactive bouncing ball algorithm. You click on the ball and throw it within the window. It displays the trail of motion for a fancy effect. Uses constants: bounce coefficient, air resistance and ground resistance. This code is adapted from Doug Pucketts bouncing balls screensaver at http://www.Planet-Source-Code.com/vb/scripts/ShowCode.asp?txtCodeId=13701&amp;lngWId=1 with changes to his bounce algorithm. Thanks. ** UPDATE: Uploaded Version with trails **
